Lighthouse was conceived to provide local insurance agents with a solution for retaining customers facing cancellation or non-renewal. Often, these situations arise due to factors such as excessive claims of a certain type or no longer aligning with a particular insurer's risk appetite. In such cases, customers are left to seek alternative coverage by approaching different carriers, a process that can be time-consuming and uncertain.

With the customer's consent, the referring agent can share pertinent details, enabling the receiving agent to assess suitability before engaging directly. This approach minimizes the need for extensive conversations and email exchanges between agents, facilitating a smoother and more efficient resolution.

Moreover, Lighthouse operates on a reciprocal basis, fostering a collaborative environment among agents. For every customer entered into the system, agents earn credits that can be redeemed to assist other customers in similar situations. This incentivizes agents to proactively engage with at-risk customers, ensuring they remain within the agency's network and fostering goodwill among agents.

In essence, Lighthouse not only helps retain potentially lost customers but also fosters cooperation among agents, ultimately benefiting both customers and agents alike.
