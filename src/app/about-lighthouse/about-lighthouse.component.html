    <h1>About Lighthouse</h1>
    <p>
      Lighthouse was conceived to provide local insurance agents with a solution
      for retaining customers facing cancellation or non-renewal. Often, these
      situations arise due to factors such as excessive claims of a certain type
      or no longer aligning with a particular insurer's risk appetite. In such
      cases, customers are left to seek alternative coverage by approaching
      different carriers, a process that can be time-consuming and uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the customer's consent, the referring agent can share pertinent
      details, enabling the receiving agent to assess suitability before
      engaging directly. This approach minimizes the need for extensive
      conversations and email exchanges between agents, facilitating a smoother
      and more efficient resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Lighthouse operates on a reciprocal basis, fostering a
      collaborative environment among agents. For every customer entered into
      the system, agents earn credits that can be redeemed to assist other
      customers in similar situations. This incentivizes agents to proactively
      engage with at-risk customers, ensuring they remain within the agency's
      network and fostering goodwill among agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In essence, Lighthouse not only helps retain potentially lost customers
      but also fosters cooperation among agents, ultimately benefiting both
      customers and agents alike.
